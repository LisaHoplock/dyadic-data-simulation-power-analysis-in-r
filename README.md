# dyadic-data-simulation-power-analysis-in-r
Contains r code for dyadic data simulation and power analyses based on existing code. 
Thanks to Courtney Soderberg, Sean Lane, and Erin Hennes for their 2018 SIPS workshop on simulation and power analyses (SIPS 2018 workshop (https://osf.io/mp2za); Randi Garcia for her dyadic data with R workshop (https://github.com/RandiLGarcia/2day-dyad-workshop/blob/master/Day 1/R Code/Day 1-Actor-Partner Interdependence Model.Rmd), and Ethan Youngâ€™s restructuring dyadic data tutorial (https://www.ethan-young.com/code/restructuring-dyadic-data/)
Worked for me using RStudio 1.2.5033; tidyr v 1.0.2; dplr v 1.0.2; nlme v 2.1153; purr v 0.3.3; and stringr v. 1.4.0 on a Mac.
